Power management systems are crucial for powering up our devices and especially for testing electronics, however, they can be bulky as noticed here by this power supply. There will come a situation whereby we want a more portable power solution and that is when the Easy_PD system comes into play.

The main working principle behind this is an ecosystem of two chips, the CH32V003, which is a small MCU, and also the CH224K. The two systems can be joined together to create a system that can request different voltages from the main source, which in this case would be our charger.
